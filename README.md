```
This is a base angular project
```

Steps to make enviornment setup
```
Make sure to create  the app by adding the --no-strickt flat to the ng new command
```

```
We might also need the bootstrap framework
to install
npm install --save bootstrap@3
```

```
In the file we still need to add Bootstrap to the styles[] array

path should be
node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
```
